The editor combines real-time 2D canvas editing with advanced 3D preview capabilities, allowing creators to design effects through direct manipulation while maintaining precise control over particle behavior, timing, and spatial relationships. Built with performance in mind, AuraFX handles thousands of particles efficiently through optimized rendering pipelines and intelligent level-of-detail systems, making it suitable for both simple effects and complex multi-layered animations that would be challenging to create through traditional code-based approaches.",
    "overview.visual.title": "Visual Editor",
    "overview.visual.desc": "The visual editor provides an intuitive drag-and-drop interface that allows creators to place particles, shapes, and effects directly on a responsive canvas with real-time feedback. This approach eliminates the need for complex coordinate calculations and YAML syntax memorization, making particle effect creation accessible to both technical and non-technical users. The editor features intelligent snapping systems, dynamic grid alignment, and contextual tool palettes that adapt based on the selected elements, ensuring precise placement while maintaining creative flexibility. Advanced features include multi-select operations, transform controls with visual handles, and instant preview updates that reflect changes across both 2D and 3D views simultaneously.",
    "overview.code.title": "Automatic Code",
    "overview.code.desc": "The automatic code generation system translates visual designs into clean, optimized MythicMobs YAML format without requiring manual coding or syntax knowledge. The system intelligently groups particles by type, optimizes coordinate precision, and generates human-readable comments that document the effect structure for easy maintenance and debugging. Advanced features include automatic effect grouping, intelligent offset calculations, and configurable export settings that allow creators to fine-tune the output format for specific server configurations or performance requirements. The generated code maintains consistency across exports, enabling version control integration and collaborative development workflows where multiple creators can work on the same effect while preserving the visual intent and technical specifications.",

The 3D editor features professional-grade camera controls including orbit, pan, and zoom operations, transform gizmos for precise positioning, and real-time lighting that accurately represents particle visibility and color relationships. Seamless integration between 2D and 3D workflows enables creators to sketch concepts quickly in 2D for rapid iteration, then refine details in 3D for final positioning and camera choreography, providing the best of both worlds for efficient effect creation.",
    "overview.panels.title": "AuraFX - Panel Interfaces",
    "overview.panels.layers": "Layers Panel",
    "overview.panels.layers.desc": "The Layers Panel serves as the central hub for organizing and managing complex particle effects through a hierarchical layer system. This powerful interface allows creators to group related particles into logical layers, control visibility independently for each layer, and apply different effect types and parameters to create sophisticated multi-layered animations. The panel provides intuitive drag-and-drop reordering capabilities, real-time visibility toggles for instant A/B testing, and centralized parameter controls that affect all elements within a layer simultaneously. Advanced features include layer-specific effect types such as Basic, Linehelix, Orbital, Ring, Line, Sphere, Tornado, and Linering, each with their own specialized parameters and behaviors. The layer system enables efficient workflow management by allowing creators to work on individual components of complex effects while maintaining the ability to preview the complete composition at any time.",

    "overview.panels.import.desc": "The Import Panel provides powerful capabilities for converting external assets into particle effects, supporting both 2D image files (PNG, GIF) and 3D model files (OBJ format). This sophisticated import system analyzes image pixels or 3D model vertices and intelligently converts them into particle positions while maintaining the visual integrity of the original asset. The panel includes advanced optimization controls such as size reduction for performance management, threshold settings for edge detection and solid region sampling, tolerance controls for color grouping to prevent excessive particle generation, and maximum element limits to ensure editor responsiveness. For 3D imports, the system provides scaling controls to match the editor's coordinate system and automatic centering to ensure proper positioning. The import process preserves color information when available and generates clean, optimized particle sets that can be immediately integrated into existing effects or used as starting points for new compositions.",
    "overview.panels.modes": "Modes Panel",
    "overview.panels.modes.desc": "The Modes Panel serves as the central control center for all animation and behavioral aspects of particle effects, providing comprehensive tools for creating dynamic, engaging animations. This powerful interface offers three main categories of modes: global animation modes that affect the entire scene, layer-specific modes that target individual layers, and logical modes that control when and how animations are triggered. Global modes include rotation controls for spinning effects around any axis, movement systems for creating breathing or swaying animations, and rainbow effects for dynamic color cycling. Layer-specific modes allow for targeted animations such as local rotation, radius-based movements, and individual particle behaviors. The logical modes section provides advanced control mechanisms including chain effects for sequencing animations, static rainbow for fixed color distributions, mirror effects for symmetrical patterns, and performance optimization settings. Each mode includes detailed parameter controls for fine-tuning timing, speed, distance, and other behavioral characteristics.",
    "overview.panels.type_settings": "Type Settings",
    "overview.panels.type_settings.desc": "The Type Settings Panel provides detailed parameter controls for the eight specialized effect types available in AuraFX, each designed to create specific particle behaviors and visual patterns. This dynamic interface adapts its controls based on the selected layer's effect type, showing only relevant parameters for the chosen effect. The Basic type offers fundamental particle placement with manual positioning control, while Linehelix creates spiral patterns with configurable distance, length, and radius parameters. Orbital effects generate circular distributions with controllable radius, point count, and timing intervals. Ring effects create perfect circular patterns with adjustable radius and point density. Line effects produce linear particle arrangements with distance controls and optional zigzag patterns. Sphere effects distribute particles evenly across spherical surfaces using advanced mathematical algorithms. Tornado effects create dynamic spiral formations with height, radius, and rotation speed controls. Linering combines linear and circular patterns for hybrid effects. Each effect type includes real-time preview capabilities and parameter validation to ensure optimal performance and visual quality.",
    "overview.panels.code": "Code Panel",
    "overview.panels.code.desc": "The Code Panel serves as the bridge between visual design and technical implementation, providing comprehensive tools for generating, managing, and exporting MythicMobs-compatible YAML code. This sophisticated system automatically translates visual particle effects into clean, optimized YAML format while maintaining all visual properties, timing information, and behavioral characteristics. The panel includes advanced code generation features such as intelligent particle grouping, automatic coordinate optimization, and configurable export settings that allow creators to fine-tune output for specific server configurations. Additional capabilities include project save and load functionality with .fxp file format support, frame rate settings for animation timing control, and real-time code preview that updates as changes are made to the visual design. The system generates human-readable code with detailed comments and documentation, making it easy for developers to understand, modify, and integrate the effects into their MythicMobs configurations.
